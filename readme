Project Iris
The aim of this project is to create a desktop application allowing access to Facebook through its extensive Graph API. This project was originally designed for reasons of accessibility. Visually impaired and blind users have often had a raw deal whenever Facebook changes the layout of the page, with things being moved around, labels changed or removed and things being made unusable altogether. This has left a gap between what people with vision can do on the world's largest social network and what blind and visually impaired users can do.
We hope to change that.
